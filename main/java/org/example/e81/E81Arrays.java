//if (i % 2 == 0 && r % 2 == 0) {
//if conditions like this
//It worked
//Why we canâ€™t do
//If (i ][r]%2==0){

//The condition if (i % 2 == 0 && r % 2 == 0) is checking if both i (the row index) and r (the column index) are even. This is the correct way to determine if an element is on an even row and an even column. The condition ensures that only elements at positions with both even row and even column indices are summe
//The condition if (i % 2 == 0 && r % 2 == 0) is used to check if both indices i and r are even. Here's the breakdown:
//
//i % 2 == 0: Checks if the row index i is even.
//r % 2 == 0: Checks if the column index r is even.
//This ensures that only elements in positions (i, r) where both i and r are even are considered.
